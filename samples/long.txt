Gojo Satoru arrives at the station and greets his classmates as the afternoon crowd swells around the plaza. The city hums with late traffic while the crowd moves in slow waves toward the exits. PronounceX should respect sentence boundaries while still splitting long spans into manageable segments for playback. We want multiple segments to test concurrency and caching without changing pronunciation rules. The first paragraph continues with extra sentences to push the chunker over its target size and into splitting mode. Another line adds more words to ensure the target is exceeded and segments are created. This paragraph keeps going with one more sentence to add length and guarantee more segments.

In the second paragraph, the narration stretches out with details about pacing, cadence, and the balance between clarity and speed. The sentences here are slightly longer, designed to push the character count up while maintaining readable structure. Each sentence is still simple, but the combined length should force several chunk boundaries across this paragraph alone. We add another sentence to increase the total length and guarantee multiple segments. The chunker should cut only when it must, keeping sentence boundaries where possible. Another sentence joins the paragraph to keep the length climbing.

The third paragraph continues the pacing discussion with a few more lines. We want enough content to ensure at least eight segments across the full job. This line adds descriptive words and repeats the pattern to keep the length high. The narration mentions concurrency, caching, and the importance of stable manifest ordering. Another sentence extends the paragraph to add more characters. Yet another sentence ensures we cross the threshold for extra segments.

Finally, a fourth paragraph wraps up with a few more lines. It should still be long enough to produce at least two chunks if the earlier paragraphs did not already do so. This final bit makes sure the test covers multiple paragraphs and enough content for concurrent synthesis. End of sample.
